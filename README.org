* RServer
  We need to put many of the setup details in this role,
  since we are doing config files templates and the like.
** Preliminaries
   The R software is donloaded, compiled,
   and installed.
   
   The Rserve software is also downloaded 
   and installed.

   A deamon script is created to launch Rserve.
** Notes
*** Touch file
    r_touchme specifies a touch file in
    the /tmp directory that is created pending
    successful cretion of Rserv. If the
    instance is rebooted, this file may be
    deleted and thus the Rserv will be rebuilt
    needlessly.

    This should not be a major concern as these servers
    will almost never be restarted. I will simply add
    time to the run of this role if it's the case.

** TODO Problem with deamon script stopping service.
** TODO Need to devise a Unit Test approach for R scripts
